                        <p style="width: 80%;">The Opta supercomputer makes Real Madrid favourites to reach an 18th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, assigning them a 49.5% chance of victory in 90 minutes.
                            Madrid are unbeaten in their last eight Champions League meetings with Bayern Munich (six wins, two draws), and have won six of their last seven against them at home (one draw).
                            While Carlo Ancelotti is bidding to reach a record-extending sixth Champions League final, Thomas Tuchel could become the first coach to make the final with three different clubs</p>

                            However, Isco produced a superb display against Argentina, whose captain Lionel Messi again watched from the stands at the Wanda Metropolitano because of fitness concerns.
                            Spain had drawn 1-1 against Germany last week and have now extended their unbeaten run under coach Julen Lopetegui to 18 matches.</p>

                        <p>An "angry" Xavi said things have to change at Barcelona after they were knocked out of the Champions League following a 3-0 defeat to Bayern Munich.

                            Barca have failed to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time since the 2003/04 season when they competed in the UEFA Cup Goals from Thomas Muller, Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala completed a 3-0 victory for Bayern Munich over Barca at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday, ensuring Xavi's side finished third in Group E and that they will compete in the Europa League round of 32 next year.

                            Xavi, who has overseen two wins, a draw and two defeats since being appointed first-team coach, lambasted his players after the final whistle and conceded that Barca are no longer at the same level as Bayern.</p>

                        <p>Fresh off his added time winner against FC Barcelona in the recent El Clasico, Real Madrid fans understandably would have been keen to see Jude Bellingham back in action this weekend. The Englishman has proven himself to be an absolute superstar since joining the club in the summer from Borussia Dortmund and is one of the contenders to win the next Ballon d'Or.

                            Unfortunately, Bellingham won't be playing this weekend. He has not been named in the squad that will take on Real Sociedad away at the Anoeta.</p>

                        </h2>

                        <p>Real Madrid are on the verge of winning another historic double. The La Liga title is already in the bag and they got there pretty comfortably. On the other hand, they are also in the Champions League final, where they will taking on Borussia Dortmund. Yet, Los Blancos could potentially sign the best player in the world to get even stronger.

                            That player is none other than Kylian Mbappe. The Frenchman has already announced that he will be leaving PSG at the end of the season.
                            
                            Where will he go? Well, it would be a major surprise if the answer to that question does not turn out to be Real Madrid. For years, there have been links and it looks like the move is finally set to happen this summer.
                            
                            Do Real Madrid really need him though? Having every great player in the world is not always the key to winning. We saw that with the Galacticos. And we saw that at PSG as well, who had Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi at the same time but could not come close to challenging for the Champions League.
                            
                            While Mbappe is a global superstar and a World Cup winner, Vinicius Junior is making a case for being the best player in the world as well.</p>
